    "I couldnt run the classifier SVM with different kernels, with 10000 samples because it was time consuming. So I have run the code with 500 samples. The best SVM was choosen as the rbf SVM because it gave the best score among all others. So I will compare my rbf SVM with mlp which is the Neural network structure with 500 samples, 1 hidden layer and 190 neurons. With mlp I had the best score 0.702 training error:0.00 and test error:0.215849. For rbf SVM the best score that I have obtained is 0.79, training error: 0.250000, test error: 0.328924. It is clear that the NN gave better results considering the training error. And for the test error ,ts almost equal but still SVM has worse results. I think that SVM gave worse results comparing with NN is because the SVM does not perform well when the number of features is greater than the number of samples. Which in our case the sample size is 500 but the feature size is 784. And the time required for SVM to compute even just 500 samples were really high compared to NN architecture."
